# About me

👋🏽 Hi there!  I'm Andreu, co-founder and CTO of Nanzen. I will use this space to share public reflections and a guide to working with me.

## How I lead (aka Andreu's 101)

I put together this short guide to give you a sense of my leadership philosophy and how I like to work. My goal is to be transparent and set us all up for success.

Our journey here is all about one thing: to **dream big and strive to get to it**. I truly believe we can be shapers, not followers. We have the talent, scale, and opportunity to achieve something incredible, and I want us to go for the full meal, not just the breadcrumbs.

#### My Guiding Principles

These are the core tenets of the culture I strive to build.

* 🤝 **It all starts with trust**. My number one priority is creating a safe environment where we can all be ourselves. This means having open communication where things that need to be said, get said—without being rude, of course.
* 🧭 **Strive for autonomy, with accountability**. I don't believe in telling smart people what to do. My role is to show you the way, but you'll have to walk it. Autonomy doesn't mean "do what you want"; we are all accountable for our results and must not settle for good enough.
* 🚀 **Execution gives clarity**. Let's avoid "paralysis analysis". It's better to start with something and correct our course if needed.
* 🌍 **Think Adyen first**. We need to focus on the global optimum, not just what's best for our team locally. Don't work in a silo; connect with other solutions, lean on your peers, and be there for them in return.
* 🏆 **Pursue greatness**. I believe in keeping the bar high, because the ceiling will be wherever we put it. It's my job as a leader and mentor to help you unlock your full potential.

#### How I Work

This is what you can expect from me day-to-day.

* 🔬 **I'm not the "parachute" person**; I don't leave people on their own but I don't micromanage either.
* 🪞 **I am quite WYSIWYG**; I cherish authenticity and I use it to establish long-lasting relationships.
* 🔎 **I will, however, seek alignment**. I'll ask questions to understand the details , as I believe technical skill in enginering leadership matters. My job is to bring questions, not answers.
* 🥊 **I will challenge you**, and I'll do it early and constantly. I see this as the foundation of building trust where you also challenge me right back.
* 🙌 **I am here to unlock your best, not to please you**. Whether you need guidance, mentorship, coaching, or just a sparring partner, I'm here for you on your journey. I am quite straightforward and I will try to be lovely but leaving nothing unsaid.
* 📞 **I am available for you, so please don't wait**. Call up or text anytime. I make it a priority to be present and available for others, let's not fall in scheduled and recurrent logistics that slow us down.

## Me as a human
Here is some trivia that shaped me as a human.

- 🏝️ I was born and grew up in the wonderful island of Mallorca, Spain. this means that I like being in the sun (I know, great move coming to NL) and you can see Mediterranean roots in my behaviour (e.g. I move my hands a lot). I studied and worked before in Barcelona, which is a city I adore. I still think I will move back there at some point.
  
- 🏡 I draw a lot of energy from my family which includes a wife and two kids (born 2018 and 2021) that just make my day every morning when I wake up. Especially when it's gloomy and dark.
  
- 💻 I studied in a very classical school and I excelled in mathematics and physics as a student but I had a very late exposure to computers (remember, that's Mallorca in the 90s). I moved on to study electro-technical eng and the first sentence of the first class of the first day was _"you can download this compiler from this ftp"_ and that gave me a reality slap as there were three words I didn't understand in that sentence. 
  
- 🚀 I worked before in aerospace and there's four satellites orbitting earth with some of my code on it. While that gives me pride I think that aerospace, as a field, is still very slow and that's one of the reasons I joined Adyen.
  
- 🎸 I love music and I play guitar. Amateur level, but I did my share of gigs in beer-infused, sweaty, rock bars. If you want to talk rock, indie, melodic house or jazz I'm always up for it.
  
- 📚 I like reading books. I particularly like science fiction (I have read everything from Isaac Asimov) and also biographies.
  
- 🤡 I love absurd and British humor, it doesn't matter if they overlap.
  
- ⚽️ I am not a hardcore fan but I support Futbol Club Barcelona. I grew up seeing Johan Cruyff coaching the team and Guardiola as captain and that marked me as a kid. Even though the club has been making questionable choices in the recent past I love the mindset of total football (high agency) and maintaining the best young talent academy of the world.

- 🐐 Messi is the GOAT and there's no discussion about it.
  
- 👻 My wife would say that my favourite movie is _Ghostbusters (1984)_. It has a good mix of entrepeneurial mindset, edge technology and absurd humor.
  
- 🇪🇸 I am Spanish but I speak 3.5 languages: Spanish, Catalan, English and 0.5 Dutch. My proudest Dutch language achievement is _succeeding at cancelling an insurance over the phone_.
